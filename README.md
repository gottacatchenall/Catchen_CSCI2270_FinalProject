# Catchen_CSCI2270_FinalProject

I'm going to make an extension to assignment 12 that implements more functionality into the hash table we already built. I'm going to change the assignment so that it builds a 'hash table of hash tables', which will use two different hash functions to store data and thus minimize collisions. I also want to add methods to print out all of the data in the hash table alphabetically, add a method to completely wipe the hash table, as well as a few others.
